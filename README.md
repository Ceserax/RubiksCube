## Rubik's Cube Simulator with Processing 

![](./sample.gif)

This simple simulator gives you all functionality of a Rubik's Cube, 
but without taking up the desk space!

Rotate the faces by clicking on them (or with the keyboard) and pan around in 3D with the mouse.

By making use of [Processing](https://processing.org/), its really simple to get up
and running in a simple 3D graphics environment. This sketch also makes use of [PeasyCam](https://github.com/jdf/peasycam) by Jonathan Feinberg.


### Controls
 + left-click turns a face clockwise
 + right-click turns it the counterclockwise
